# Currency Calculator

## Overview
This project is a simple Currency Convertor built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert between different currencies. While the current version provides basic functionality, its accuracy can be improved by integrating a reliable API for real-time exchange rates.

## Features
- **Currency Conversion:** Supports basic currency calculations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and clean design.
- **Expandable:** Can be enhanced by integrating a better currency exchange API.

## Getting Started

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
1. Enter the amount and select the currencies to convert.
2. Click the `Get your Currency` button to see the result.
3. The result obtained will be almost similar to the current exchange rate, but you can get the current result if a better api is used.
